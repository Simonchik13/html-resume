    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I am an accountant with a passion for technology. My goal is to become an exceptional Software Developer. 
        I have recently started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and tools for them through the course of Web Development by Dr. Angela Yu. 
        I love learning Computer Science and expanding my knowledge of Mathematics. 
        I strive to ensure my code is well-structured therefore I try to code and practice every day</p>
    
        <p>I used to work as an accountant but left my job due to moving to the UK and looking after my son. 
        But even during that period, I continued to study at the Association of Accountants in the UK and take exams. 
        I believe my ability to learn, adaptability, responsibility, attention to detail and experience working with numbers will help me to become a Software Developer. 
        I'm currently exploring the world of technology and enjoying it</p>
